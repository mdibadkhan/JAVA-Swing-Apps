# JAVA-Swing-Apps
It is a public repository in which I have uploaded Apps made in Java Swing. This is for reference purpose and will serve as examples for those who are learning Java GUIs.

The java files in this repository will only run on your computer if it has JDK/JRE intalled and is properly configured (added in the Environmant).

**Images of the apps for reference :**
